# LogParser
## What is LogParser?

LogParser is an application that parses errlog files (application error files) generated from windows applications developed by Quidgest. As these files become huge it becomes cumbersome to track error causes or application faults. By parsing these files one can do faster searches by categorizing, filtering or sorting errors.

It is currently being used as the tool for parsing errors at HR Information Systems department and its windows applications, parsing hundreds of megabytes of files in seconds.
